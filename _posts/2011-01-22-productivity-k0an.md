A note to this little perfectionist in myself and everyone else,
reminding how the things are in the real life:


A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,
frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a
difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit
him on the back of his head and shouted ‘Type something!’ The student
started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly
understood the beautiful solution.

Thanks [Lambda the Ultimate][LtU] for mentioning this excellent writing, by the way!
