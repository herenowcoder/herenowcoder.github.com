title: Js is an assembler dronized
---

Here's a flaw of today's web programming:

Javascript was invented to be the web assembler, to bring the dynamism to the static nature of http by filling in gaps by dirty hacks. But at the same time, it was given the syntax to attract corporate drones and "consultants" instead of assembler-loving hackers.

Somebody hasn't really thought it well...

Well I really would want to code assembler if it had a syntax like one! You don't put a coal miner in tuxedo when he's mining, do you? :)
