Now a twisted turn of cause and effect:

A hacker called jwz, having dropped coding mostly because of ugliness
of javascript and a story behind its sneaky blending with the
browsers, had a time and found some fun in raising the club in SF,
which will be now hosting [**the FreeBSD 20th Anniversary Party**][fbsd20y].

;-]

Have fun folks there!!
