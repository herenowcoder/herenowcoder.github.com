A note to this little perfectionist in myself and everyone else,
reminding how the things are in the real life:

A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,
frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a
difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit
him on the back of his head and shouted ‘Type something!’ The student
started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly
understood the beautiful solution.

I found this pearl in the Eloquent JavaScript book. Thanks Lambda the
Ultimate for mentioning this excellent writing, btw!
