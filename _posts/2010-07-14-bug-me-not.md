I discovered a subtle bug in my recent writeup on partials. It manifested when I tried to nest def_partial usage.
The def_partial helper was initially defined as:

{% highlight ruby %}
def def_partial new_meth, f, *args0
  add_code do
    define_method new_meth, partial(f, *args0)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
The problem was that if you passed a symbol for method to be searched for, the partial code ran its method(f) ... in the context introduced by `module_eval` called from `add_code`, so the receiver of method call was not the original object from the scope where youâ€™d like to look method for.

The obvious fix was to call partial before entering `module_eval`:
{% highlight ruby %}
def def_partial new_meth, f, *args0
  closure = partial(f, *args0)
  add_code do
    define_method new_meth, closure
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The original blog entry is fixed to not expose this bug to new visitors.
